Real estate price prediction
Real estate sector in India is expected to reach a market size of US$ 1 trillion by 2030 from US$ 120 billion in 2017 and contribute 13% to the countryâ€™s GDP by 2025. (Source: ibef.org)



Consider that you're hired by a top Indian MNC as a 'Machine Learning Analyst' to the 'Real Estate Project Team'. Your job description asks you to integrate a ML solution to the company's software which will predict the price of a property that the customer choose. Before assigning you to the main team, you are required to develop a sample model which will be capable of doing nearly the same task. Luckily, you do not have to bother about the front-end as you need to only develop the model in any python environments.


You are given a dummy dataset of collection of houses in different regions in the USA for doing the task ie., USA_Housing.csv
The data contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income'                         : Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in. ,

'Avg. Area House Age'                   : Avg Age of Houses in same city 

'Avg. Area Number of Rooms'      : Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city

'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms' : Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city

'Area Population'                            : Population of city house is located in

'Price'                                               : Price that the house sold at

'Address'                                          : Address for the house
